        <h2>Tiers:</h2>
        <p>I create a tier list based in the <b><a href="https://www.overbuff.com/heroes">Overbuff</a></b> stats, are adjusted taking into consideration the win rate and the pick rate.</p>
        <p>I'm trying to have a general tier list make out of my sources, right now I'm using <b><a href="https://www.metabomb.net/overwatch/gameplay-guides/overwatch-tier-list-season-16-june-2019">Metabomb</a></b></p>
